# Sleep Disorder Diagnostic System

Welcome to the repository for our advanced diagnostic system dedicated to identifying sleep disorders. This system employs machine learning to analyze sleep health data, offering valuable insights into sleep patterns and potential disruptions.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Comprehensive analysis of sleep health data to detect patterns and irregularities.
- **Diagnostic Tool:** Leverages machine learning models, specifically a Gradient Boosting Classifier, to accurately diagnose potential sleep disorders from the input data.
- - **Machine Learning:** Features a Gradient Boosting Classifier to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
- **User Interface:** An interactive and user-friendly interface developed with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
- **AI Integration:** Incorporates a responsive AI chatbot powered by [GPT-Turbo-3.5](https://openai.com/research/gpt-turbo) to assist users with queries related to sleep disorders and system navigation.
